# Introduction
Over the past year, I have modified my introductory physics curriculum after experiencing FIRST Lego League (FLL) through the lens of a coach. In FLL, students are tasked with completing a series of challenges, for which they earn points, using a Lego robot in autonomous mode. In previous years, students had constructed a rover capable of navigating autonomously and completed one of the challenges laid out here (challenge 4 -- the maze challenge).

Now, however, thanks to my FLL experiences, I have expanded from one challenge to ten total challenges. This resulted in the creation of a Rover Challenges Arena, which will be described here in detail. Specifically, I will highlight:

* The construction of the arena
* The challenges themselves

# Challenges Arena Construction
The Challenges Arena was constructed with the aid of a lasercutter, 3D printer, and hand saw. Below you will find the complete list of materials used.

For Challenge 5: Surface Navigation, I made a model of the lunar surface because I wanted students to experience navigating difficult terrain; to create this, I used the following materials:
* D
* D
* D
* D

In addition to these materials, I also used 3mm hex screws and nuts, which can be found below:
* D
* D

I decided to use spray paint for the stencils, although in retrospect, it may have been easier to use acrylic paint since many of the numbers didn't come out as well as I wanted to. Here is the spray painting equipment I used:
