[IMAGE OF CHALLENGES ARENA -- PHYSICAL]

# Introduction
Over the past year, I have modified my introductory physics curriculum after experiencing FIRST Lego League (FLL) through the lens of a coach. In FLL, students are tasked with completing a series of challenges, for which they earn points, using a Lego robot in autonomous mode. In previous years, students had constructed a rover capable of navigating autonomously and completed one of the challenges laid out here (challenge 4 -- the maze challenge).

Now, however, thanks to my FLL experiences, I have expanded from one challenge to ten total challenges. This resulted in the creation of a Rover Challenges Arena, which will be described here in detail. Specifically, I will highlight:

* The construction of the arena
* The challenges themselves

# Challenges Arena Construction
The Challenges Arena was constructed with the aid of a lasercutter, 3D printer, and hand saw. Below you will find the complete list of materials used.

**Spray Painting**

I decided to use spray paint for the stencils, although in retrospect, it may have been easier to use acrylic paint since many of the numbers didn't come out as well as I wanted to. Here is the spray painting equipment I used:

* [Rust-Oleum Black Camouflage Spray Paint ($6.98)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rust-Oleum-Specialty-12-oz-Black-Camouflage-Spray-Paint-279179/326885188)

* [3M Professional Paint Spray Respirator Medium ($48.98)](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-Professional-Paint-Spray-Respirator-Medium-7512PA1-A-PS/202077812)

## CAD Model

[IMAGE OF CAD MODEL]

The fully completed CAD model is included above. It is important to note that there are over 150 parts to this design, so there will be a lot that needs to be lasercut and 3D printed. It is my largest project as of writing. Nevertheless, I do hope that the organization of the folders will make it easier to manufacture the components for this.

## 3D-Printed Parts
All parts that need to be 3D printed will be inside folders called "3D Prints", which will be inside each of the challenge's main folder.

### 3D Printing Process
The 3D printing process is quite lengthy given the large number of parts. However, expect around ~3 weeks of continuous printing to print all parts necessary for this project. The material used was included the previous materials section (True Red PLA from ELEGOO). Below you will find more information regarding the printer and settings used.

#### 3D Printer
Original Prusa Mini+

#### Software
PrusaSlicer

#### Settings
Layer Height: .2mm \
Infill: 50% \
Supports: Everywhere \
Estimated Printing Time: ~ 3 weeks.

## Laser Cut Parts
For the laser cut parts, which can be found in two separate folders -- "Laser Cuts" for parts that will be cut from the walnut sheets and "Stencils" for those that will be cut from the cardboard sheets -- are inside each of the challenge's main folder.

### Laser Cutting Process
Luckily, it is much quicker to fully cut all parts that need to be laser cut for this challenges arena. Make sure to remember to use cardboard for the stencils.

#### Lasercutter
XTool D1 Pro

#### Software
XTool Creative Studio (XCS)

#### Settings (for cutting)
Power (%): 100 \
Speed (mm/s): 5 \
Pass: 1

## Hand Sawn Parts
The last set of parts are those that need to be sawn. I purchased the large walnut sheets from Home Depot and got someone there to saw most of them for me. For the small parts, I used a hand saw. Below are the dimensions required:

* 1 44" x 40"
* 1 44" x 20"
* 1 44" x 10"
* 2 38" x 18.5"
* 2 24" x 20"
* 1 20" x 10"

Once you have finished these parts, you will be ready to use the stencils and spray paint.

## Stencils and Spray Painting

[SPRAY PAINT IMAGE]

For spray painting, I went outside on a nice cool day and began color coding things. You might do things differently, but you can tell from the pictures of the challenges how I decided to color things. In retrospect, as I mentioned before, I think I should have opted for acrylic paint because some of the spray paint didn't stick too well or bled out too much into the wood grain.

## Assembly
Once all parts have been completed and relevant parts spray painted, it's time for assembly. I highly suggest building the middle layer first so you can connect the large walnut sheet across both tables, which will provide some stability as you go on to assemble the rest. I expct assembly to take a full day or two given all the parts and screwing of components required.

For Challenge 5: Surface Navigation, I recommend adding some tape along the walls so the mixture doesn't seep through easily. You can include as many or as few rocks as you would like. I recommend using the medium-sized rocks all throughout the surface and the larger rocks for Challenge 1: Hercules's Push and maybe a few spread out on the Challenge 5: Surface Navigation.

# Challenges Overview
This part is the most relevant for students as it relates to what each challenge is specifically asking, so some students viewing this repository might want to skip to this section. For each challenge, there is an **Engineering Component** and a **Physics Component**. Students will be awarded points based on both the physical completion of the challenge (the former) and the completion of the mini-lab associated with it (the latter).

A complete description of each challenge will be found below. Please note that the maximum number of points possible is 800, but teams average around 100-200 historically.

## Challenge 1: Hercules's Push
[IMAGE of CHALLENGE FIELD]

**Engineering Component**

For this challenge, students are tasked with pushing a lava rock from one end of the field to the other. Points are determined based on accuracy to the target location as shown below:

| Distance from Target  | Points Awarded |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Not Attempted  | 0  |
| <2cm  | 20  |
| <4cm  | 15  |
| <6cm  | 5  |

**Physics Component**

This challenge requires students to be familiar with kinematics (as well as forces) concepts and coding in micropython, as they will be required to:

* Program their rover so that it has constant acceleration
* Use a kinematic equation to determine the push and net accelerations of their rover
* Create force diagrams for the lava rock
* Determine force of friction on the lava rock

More details on how students are graded for this can be found in the assignment itself, which is under Documents in Challenge 1: Hercules's Push folder. The document is listed as docx and PDF files.

The grading rubric, which is the same for all challenges, is included below:

| Proficiency Level  | Points Awarded | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **Not Yet**: You have not correctly completed any of the elements of this challenge component. | 0 | 50% |
| **Approaching Proficiency**: You have correctly completed at least one element of this challenge component. | 10 | 60% |
| **Somewhat Proficient**: You have correctly completed half of the elements of this challenge component. | 20 | 70% |
| **Proficient**: You have correctly completed all of the elements of this challenge component. | 30 | 85% |
| **Exceeding Proficiency**: You have additionally and correctly completed the independent element of this challenge component.  | 40 | 100% |

**Student Example**

This was a very easy challenge for most students to complete; below you can see an example from a team who completed it.

| ------------- | ------------- |
| Not Attempted  | 0  |
| <2cm  | 20  |
| <4cm  | 15  |
| <6cm  | 5  |

**Physics Component**

This challenge requires students to be familiar with kinematics (as well as forces) concepts and coding in micropython, as they will be required to:

* Program their rover so that it has constant acceleration
* Use a kinematic equation to determine the push and net accelerations of their rover
* Create force diagrams for the lava rock
* Determine force of friction on the lava rock

More details on how students are graded for this can be found in the assignment itself, which is under Documents in Challenge 1: Hercules's Push folder. The document is listed as docx and PDF files.

The grading rubric, which is the same for all challenges, is included below:

| Proficiency Level  | Points Awarded | Grade |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **Not Yet**: You have not correctly completed any of the elements of this challenge component. | 0 | 50% |
| **Approaching Proficiency**: You have correctly completed at least one element of this challenge component. | 10 | 60% |
